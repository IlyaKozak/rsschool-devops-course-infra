### Task 2 - Basic Infrastructure Configuration

- Terraform code resources are added to create networking infrastructure in AWS. The infrastructure will be used for housing K8s cluster components - 1 VPC, 2 public & 2 private subnets spread across two AZs
- Internet Gateway and NAT Instance/Bastion created
- Proper routing configured

### Task 1 - AWS Account Configuration

- Created a remote backend for Terraform (AWS S3 bucket)
- Configured OpenID Connect (OIDC) for GitHub Actions
- Created a Github Actions workflow for deployment of resources to AWS via Terraform with temporarily credentials

**OIDC Diagram:**

![Diagram](tasks-images/task1-diagram.png)

**Usage:**

1. Create S3 remote state backend bucket (`remote-state` folder) and DynamoDB for state lock _[one-time setup]_:

- `aws configure`
- `cd remote-state`
- `terraform init`
- `terraform apply`

2. Fill out S3 bucket and DynamoDB info in `provider.tf` in `backend` block and run commands to create GithubActions role in AWS to be able create AWS resources from GitHub Actions workflow with OIDC temporarily credentials and GithubActions role to assume _[one-time setup]_:

- `cd ..`
- `terraform init`
- `terraform apply`

3. Configure SSH:

- Save generated by terraform private key: `terraform output -raw key_pair.private_key > key.pem`
- On your local computer configure SSH agent forwarding, so that you can use the NAT instance as a bastion server: `ssh-add key.pem`
- Connect to your NAT instance: `ssh -A ec2-user@nat-instance-public-ip-address`
- From your NAT instance, connect to your instance in your private subnet by using its private IP address: `ssh ec2-user@private-server-private-ip-address`

4. Add secret `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME` and environment variable `AWS_REGION` in GitHub repo for GitHub Actions workflow run

5. Create Pull Request/Push to `main` branch for starting GitHub Actions workflow job `terraform` to deploy AWS resources with Terraform

6. `terraform destroy` to destroy AWS resources
